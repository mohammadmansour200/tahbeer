# Privacy Policy for Tahbeer

**Last Updated:** October 17, 2025

This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which Tahbeer ("the App") is provided by Mohammad
Abdul-Tawab to users.

## 1. Data Collection and Processing

### 1.1 Personal Data

**Tahbeer DOES NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal data or personally identifiable
information from your device.**

We do not require you to create an account, log in, or provide any personal details such as your
name, email address, or phone number to use the core features of the App.

### 1.2 Audio/Video and Transcription Data (On-Device Processing)

The core functionality of Tahbeer—converting audio and video into text—relies on the following
technologies:

1. **whisper.cpp:** For speech recognition and transcription.
2. **ML Kit:** For translation services (if activated by the user).

**Crucially, all audio processing, transcription, and translation activities take place LOCALLY on
your device.**

* **Your audio/video files are never uploaded to our servers or to any third-party service for
  processing.**
* The resulting text transcripts and generated subtitle files remain on your device unless you
  choose to export or share them using your device's operating system features.

### 1.3 Usage and Technical Data

**Tahbeer DOES NOT collect any non-personal, aggregated technical data, crash logs, or usage
statistics.** We do not track device type, feature usage, or operating system versions for the
purpose of internal statistics or improvement.

***

## 2. Third-Party Services

Tahbeer uses **Google's ML Kit** library for its optional translation feature. While the processing
is typically on-device, some specific ML Kit models or features may involve data transmission to
Google for processing under Google's terms. We recommend you review
the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
and [ML Kit Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/terms) for more information on
their practices.

## 3. Children's Privacy

Tahbeer is not directed to, and does not knowingly collect information from, children under the age
of 13. Given the nature of our on-device data processing, we do not require any age verification.

## 4. Open Source and Licensing (GPLv3)

Tahbeer is distributed under the **GNU General Public License version 3 (GPLv3)**.

* This means the source code for Tahbeer is publicly available for examination, modification, and
  redistribution.
* This open approach reinforces transparency regarding the App's operations and data handling.
* The full text of the GPLv3 license can be found in the App's source code repository
